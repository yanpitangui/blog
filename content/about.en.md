Hello, I'm Yan Pitangui, a software developer based in Brazil.
<br/>
I started as a fullstack developer, but over time I focused on backend and Azure.
<br/>
I really like working with C#/.NET, JS/TS and I also started to learn Rust.
<br/>
Lately I've been studying cloud native computing (with Orleans) and observability (with OpenTelemetry).
<br/>
Here you will find material that I share in the hope that it will be useful to someone.
