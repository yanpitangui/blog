Hi, I'm Yan Pitangui, a software developer based in Brazil.
<br/>
I started as a fullstack developer but over time I've become focused on backend and Azure.
<br/>
I really like working with C#/.NET and I've also began learning Rust.
<br/>
Lately, I've been studying cloud native computing (with Orleans) and Observability (with OpenTelemetry).
<br/>
Here you will find stuff that I share in hope that it becomes useful for someone.
