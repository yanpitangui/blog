I started as a fullstack developer, but over time I focused on backend and Azure. I really like working with C#/.NET, JS/TS and I also started to learn Rust. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying cloud native computing (with Orleans) and observability (with OpenTelemetry). Here you will find material that I share in the hope that it will be useful to someone.</description></item></channel></rss>
